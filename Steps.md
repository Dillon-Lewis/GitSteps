Making a Repository and Adding to it

1st. Initiate the repo. In the Terminal in VS Code, input "git init".

 2nd. We need to add the files. In VSC terminal type "git add ." to add all files. For specific files, type "git add" and the name of the file.

 3rd. On your Github.com profile, hit the BIG GREEN BUTTON and lets create a new Repository!

 4th. After naming the new repo, copy the URL provided to the clipboard.

 5th. Back in VSC, in the terminal, type "git commit -m "message here"". Message must be in quotes! This will submit the current file to be uploaded.

 6th. Check the status using "git status" and make sure you have no errors. If errors are seen, repeat step 2 and then step 5!

 7th. Using the URL from Github.com, in terminal type "git remote add origin URL" to link the two together

 8th. Verify you have a positive push and fetch with "git remote -v"

 9th. Push the final product to github through the terminal with command "git push origin main"

 Basque in the hard work you did!!!
